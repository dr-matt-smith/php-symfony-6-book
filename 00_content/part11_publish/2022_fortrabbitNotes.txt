Publishing to Fortrabbit

---
create free account on Fortrabbit
https://www.fortrabbit.com/

---
create new Fortrabbit symfony app - can use free trial plan (will be deleted after 24-48 hours if using this free option)
NOTE:
I like to change the APP_ENV environment variable from "prod" to "dev"
this means you'll get the Symfony debug toolbar when publishing your site - so can look at routing and things like that ....

---
git clone to local machine
copy your Symfony project files into the new folder

---
generate the Apache ".htaccess" file by adding the Symfony Apache-Pack package to the project
composer require symfony/apache-pack
---
delete any old migrations
generate a new migration

---
git add / commit / push updated project to the Fortrabbit git server
you may need to add / create an SSH key for this: https://help.fortrabbit.com/ssh-troubleshooting

---
Using SSH run these 3 commands on the remote server:
NOTE: the symfony CLI is not installed, so write "php bin/console ..."  instead of "symfony console ...."

php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
php bin/console cache:clear
